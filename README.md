# mgrad

a pedagogical forray into micrograd

After watching [Karpathy's excellent videos on micrograd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0), I felt like writing my own backpropagation libray from scratch for learning purposes.

I've tried not to look at the [micrograd repo](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd) while doing this exercise.
